IN THIS PROJECT I AM TRYING TO COPY AN INDUSTRIAL USE CASE IN WHICH AS SOON AS THE DEVELOPER WHO IS WORKING ON MASTER BRANCH
COMMITS HIS FILES ARE AUTOMATICALLY PUSHED TO GITHUB .FROM HERE JENKINS COMES INTO PLAY AND AUTOMATICALLY LAUNCHES A DOCKER CONTAINER
IN WHICH THE WEBSITE IS HOSTED AND CAN BE SEEN BY CLIENTS IMMEDIATELY.
THIS SCENARIO RESEMBLES TO SCENARIO OF PRODUCTION TEAM IN A INDUSTRY WHO WORK ON MASTER BRANCH AND ANY CHANGES MADE BY THEM ARE
IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE TO CUTOMER 

ANOTHER DEVELOPER WORKING ON DEV1 BRANCH CAN WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY ON SAME FILE AND WHEN HIS CHANGES ARE APPROVED BY QUALITY ASSRANCE TEAM IT COULD BE MERGED TO MASTER BRANCHED AND DEPLOYED IMMEDIATELY
